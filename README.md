# Testing results
Files with **.out** format are the results of the hmmsearch against a pHMM.<br>
In each of these output file the out-commented lines in the very beginning of the file contain the<br>
filename of the pHMM that was searched against and the name of the fasta file in which the sequences were aligned against the pHMM.

Files retrieved from UniProt/SwissProt (these files were too large to be stored in the github repository):
